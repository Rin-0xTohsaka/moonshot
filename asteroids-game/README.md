Storyline:
"Cosmic Cleanup: The Last Starfighter"

In the year 2084, Earth's solar system has become cluttered with dangerous space debris, asteroids, and abandoned alien artifacts. As the last graduate of the now-defunct Starfighter Academy, you've been called out of retirement for one final mission: clear the solar system, planet by planet, to ensure humanity's safe expansion into space.

Game Structure:

1. Solar System Progress:
   - The game progresses through the solar system, starting from the outer planets and moving inward.
   - Each planet represents a level, with unique challenges and objectives.
   - 8 main levels (one for each planet), plus bonus levels for dwarf planets or moons.

2. Level Objectives:
   - Clear a certain number of asteroids
   - Collect specific artifacts
   - Destroy alien drones or space junk
   - Protect space stations or satellites
   - Time-based challenges

3. Progression System:
   - Earn "Stardust" as currency for destroying asteroids and completing objectives
   - Use Stardust to upgrade your ship between levels

4. Upgrades:
   - Faster movement
   - Rapid-fire weapons
   - Shield generator
   - Special weapons (e.g., homing missiles, area-effect bombs)

5. Challenges and Enemies:
   - Different types of asteroids (some split, some are indestructible)
   - Alien drones that shoot back
   - Gravity wells that affect movement
   - Solar flares that temporarily disable shields

6. Power-ups:
   - Temporary invincibility
   - Extra lives
   - Weapon enhancements
   - Time slowdown

7. Scoring System:
   - Points for destroying asteroids and enemies
   - Bonus points for completing levels quickly
   - Multipliers for consecutive hits without missing

8. End Game:
   - Final boss battle near Earth (perhaps a massive space station gone rogue)
   - Multiple endings based on performance throughout the game

Level Structure:
1. Pluto: Tutorial level, basic asteroid clearing
2. Neptune: Introduce alien drones
3. Uranus: Gravity wells affect movement
4. Saturn: Ring challenge - navigate through dense asteroid fields
5. Jupiter: Protect space stations while clearing asteroids
6. Mars: Time challenge - clear asteroids before a solar flare hits
7. Venus: Dense atmosphere reduces visibility, rely on radar
8. Mercury: Extreme heat - manage your ship's temperature while fighting
9. Earth: Final boss battle

Each level should take about 3-5 minutes to complete, making the entire game beatable in about 30-45 minutes for skilled players, but with high replayability due to upgrades and score chasing.
